## Supporting

The best support right now is your star for the project. You can also help spread the word about the app in the public.

<!-- ## Feature for now
- Support M1
- Syntax highlighting over 170 languages
- API to fetch snippets on the localhost -->

## Features
### Organization
massCode allows you to organize snippets using multi-level folders as well as tags. Each snippet has fragments - tabs, which gives even greater level of organization.

### Editor
A snippet manager must not only provide organization of snippets but also have a good code editor. That's why under the hood of massCode there's [Ace](https://ace.c9.io). Ace is a high performance code editor which supports syntax highlighting for over 170 languages. We also added a [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to code formatter.

### Markdown
massCode allows you to write in Markdown and also provide syntax highlighting inside a code block. And of course there is a preview.

### Search
It is impossible to imagine a productive snippets manager without quick access to snippets. Therefore massCode has a fast full-text search with highlighting of the search query.

### Autosave
massCode automatically saves any changes you make during work, so you don't have to worry about losing changes.

### Sync
You can use any service that provides cloud synchronization, such as iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox or other similar.

### Database
massCode uses a simple JSON to store your data. The database files are on your local computer.

### API Server
Coming soon.

## Overview

The goal of creating this application was mostly my own growth as a developer. Also, I wanted this project to absorb the best of such applications already on the market (both free and paid). At the same time, I wanted this project to be an open source project.

massCode allows you to organize snippets using multi-level folders as well as tags. Each snippet has fragments - tabs, which gives even greater level of organization.
