# Requests

<AppVersion text=">=5.3" />

Requests are the main items in the HTTP space. Each request stores the method, URL, params, headers, body, auth settings, and a markdown description.

## Creating Requests

Create a request from the request list header or from a folder context menu. New requests are created in the selected folder.

Request context menus include actions for:

- duplicate
- delete
- copy request preview
- copy internal link
- reveal in file manager

## Request Editor

The request editor is split into focused tabs:

- **Params** - query parameters sent with the URL
- **Headers** - request headers
- **Body** - JSON, text, form URL encoded, or multipart form data
- **Auth** - none, bearer token, or basic auth
- **Description** - markdown notes for the request

Changes are saved automatically while you edit.

## Body

Use the body tab to choose the payload format for methods that send data.

- **JSON** and **Text** use a CodeMirror editor.
- **Form URL Encoded** uses key-value rows.
- **Multipart Form Data** supports text and file rows.

## Sending Requests

Send the selected request with one of these methods:

- Click the send button next to the URL field.
- Select **"Editor"** > **"Send Request"** from the menu bar.
- Press <kbd>Cmd+Enter</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> on Windows or Linux.

## Preview

The lower panel can show the outgoing request before it is sent.

- **HTTP** preview shows the request line, host, headers, and body.
- **cURL** preview builds a command you can paste into a terminal.

Use the copy button in the preview panel to copy the active preview.

## Response Viewer

After a request is sent, the response panel shows:

- status, duration, and response size
- body and headers tabs
- JSON formatting for JSON responses
- copy action for response body and headers

HTTP has its own editor preferences, including line wrapping for request previews, request bodies, and response viewers.
