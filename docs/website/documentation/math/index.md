# Math Notebook

<AppVersion text=">=4.6" />

Calculator-style notepad inspired by [Soulver](https://soulver.app). Write expressions in natural language — results appear instantly on every line.

## Arithmetic

Standard math operators and parentheses.

```
10 + 5         → 15
20 * 3         → 60
(2 + 3) * 4    → 20
2 ^ 10         → 1,024
5 300          → 5,300
```

## Word Operators

Use words instead of symbols.

```
8 times 9             → 72
100 plus 50           → 150
10 and 5              → 15
10 with 5             → 15
200 without 30        → 170
20 subtract 3         → 17
10 multiplied by 3    → 30
100 divide by 4       → 25
17 mod 5              → 2
```

## Variables

Declare variables with `=` and reuse them across lines.

```
v = 20       → 20
v times 7    → 140
v + 10       → 30
```

## Labels

Prefix a line with a label followed by a colon — the label is ignored, only the expression is evaluated.

```
Price: $11 + $34.45    → 45.45 USD
Monthly: 1200 / 12     → 100
```

## Inline Quotes

Text inside double quotes is ignored.

```
$275 for the "Model 227"    → 275 USD
```

## Percentage
